The year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While the
exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because of the
way that the calendar is constructed, I've used the following dates for this project:

 _____________________________
|  Season     |   First day    |
|-------------|----------------|
|  Spring     |   March 20     | 
|  Summer     |   June 21      |
|  Fall       |   September 22 |
|  Winter     |   December 21  |
 ------------------------------

The program reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter
the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an
integer. Then program displays the season associated with the date that
was entered.
