The program reads a date from the user and computes its immediate successor.
For example, if the user enters values that represent 2013-11-18 then program
displays a message indicating that the day immediately after 2013-11-18 is
2013-11-19. If the user enters values that represent 2013-11-30 then the program
indicates that the next day is 2013-12-01. If the user enters values that represent
2013-12-31 then the program indicates that the next day is 2014-01-01. The
date will be entered in numeric form with three separate input statements; one for
the year, one for the month, and one for the day. Program works
correctly for leap years.
