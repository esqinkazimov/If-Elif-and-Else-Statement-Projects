The following table lists the sound level in decibels for several common noises.

Noise Decibel level  (dB)

Jackhammer           130

Gas lawnmower        106

Alarm clock          70

Quiet room           40



The program reads a sound level in decibels from the user. If the user
enters a decibel level that matches one of the noises in the table then program
displays a message containing only that noise. If the user enters a number
of decibels between the noises listed then program displays a message
indicating which noises the level is between. Program also generates
reasonable output for a value smaller than the quietest noise in the table, and for a
value larger than the loudest noise in the table.
