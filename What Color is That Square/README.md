Positions on a chess board are identified by a letter and a number. The letter identifies
the column, while the number identifies the row.

The program reads a position from the user. It uses an if statement to determine if 
the column begins with a black square or a white square. Then it uses modular
arithmetic to report the color of the square in that row. For example, if the user enters
a1 then program reports that the square is black. If the user enters d5
then program reports that the square is white. The program assumes
that a valid position will always be entered. It does not perform any error
checking.
